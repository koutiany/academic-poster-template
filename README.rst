 A template for (more) accessible posters, using HTML+CSS
==========================================================
*** I used this template to build a more accessible poster during my fellowship at the CTLI 2023-2024.
View the completed poster titled "Bridging the Gap: Unveiling the Need for AI Literacy in Higher Education through Student Insights and Fundamental Concepts" at https://koutiany.github.io/ctli-aiposter/tutorial/poster.html

Notes from the creater

Modern HTML+CSS is more than enough for most academic posters:

- No more fighting with LaTeX+Beamer or PowerPoint/LibreOffice.
- It works on computers, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Readers can adjust the font size trivially.
- It's much more accessible than PDFs.

See it in action `on a real example <https://cpitclaudel.github.io/academic-poster-template/koika/poster.html>`__ and `follow the tutorial <https://cpitclaudel.github.io/academic-poster-template/tutorial/poster.html>`__ to create your own posters.
