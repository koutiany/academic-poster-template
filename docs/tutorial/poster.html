        <header><h3>Introduction</h3></header>

    <p>When ChatGPT came out in November 2022, it made a big splash in the world of Artificial Intelligence. Since then, AI has become more and more part of classrooms. </p>
    <p>Different schools have reacted in different ways. For example, Dr. Terwiesch from the Wharton School said that ChatGPT helped him spend less time on making tests, so he could spend more time helping students. On the other hand, the NYC Education Department stopped anyone in schools from using ChatGPT, worrying about potential misuse.</p>

    <p>In August 2023, MSU warned about being careful when using AI tools with sensitive or private information.</p>

    <p>This project looks at how MSU students use AI for their studies and research. This project contains three components:</p>
    <li>Interviews on AI with students at MSU</li>
    <li>Basic Concepts Explained</li>
    <li>A Proposed Course on AI Literacy</li>

    <header><h3>Section 1.1 Interview Questions </h3></header>
    <ol>
      <li>When you think of "artificial intelligence" what ideas or feelings do you have?</li>
      <li>Do you use any technology related to artificial intelligence? How do you use it?</li>
      <li>What has Michigan State University provided regarding artificial intelligence? Can you remember any specific details?</li>
      <li>If you have enough time, what parts of artificial intelligence would you like to learn?</li>
    </ol>

    <header><h3>Section 1.2.1 Interviews Analysis Using Text Analysis Tools</h3></header>

      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koutiany/ctli-aiposter/blob/main/docs/tutorial/wordcloud.png" alt="word cloud visualization created based on the transcript. More frequent used words are ai, people, don't, think.">

    <p>This image gives us a first look at the conversation summaries: people mentioned topics like data, ChatGPT, learning, students (including graduate students), algorithms, ethics, and grammar. We’ll look more closely at some of these topics later.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koutiany/ctli-aiposter/blob/main/docs/tutorial/distribution.png" alt="Word distribution visualization across all interviewees. Five words are used: ai, people, chatgpt, eth*, teach.">

    <p>It's obvious that 'ChatGPT' is a common term that almost everyone mentioned. Also, the idea of 'ethics'—sometimes called 'ethic,' 'ethically,' or 'ethical'—came up in nearly all the responses. We'll go into more detail about this in our thorough analysis of the conversations.</p>

    <header><h3>Section 1.2.2 Interviews Analysis Using Qualitative Approach</h3></header>
    <ol>
      <li>When asked the first question, most people immediately thought of chatbots like ChatGPT. Two graduate students also mentioned more complex ideas like large language models, machine learning, and algorithms.</li>
      <li>Four out of seven people we talked to said they use ChatGPT and Grammarly. One person mentioned he doesn't use ChatGPT but uses Grammarly when it's part of Word. Another person who doesn't use ChatGPT uses Amazon's Alexa every day. Most people think of ChatGPT and Grammarly when they think about AI tools. Two people mentioned they use ChatGPT and other unseen tools that operate similarly in the background.</li>
      <li>People studying science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) see more AI-related activities and hear about AI more often in classes, where it might be mentioned in brief or discussed in depth. However, students in social sciences and humanities don't encounter AI as much. One person noted a rule change in a class from being allowed to use AI for help to not allowing the use of AI tools at all.</li>
      <li>Regarding what they want to learn about AI, six out of seven people we talked to were interested in the ethics of using AI. They were quite clear about this, saying things like "Ethics is very important," "I’m more interested in discussing AI and philosophy than learning how the technology works," "I think the ethical and social effects are important and useful to learn about," "It’s important to understand digital skills at all levels of university," and "Ethics comes first." They want to understand AI better to discuss and critique it effectively, especially as it evolves quickly.</li>

    <header><h3>Section 2.1 A Basic Concept</h3></header>
    <h4>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h4>
    <figure>
      <img style="width: 50%" style="height:50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koutiany/ctli-aiposter/blob/main/docs/tutorial/nlp.png" alt="A diagram created by Saxon AI on Natural Language Processing in AI. There are three circles, left one is called AI, upper right one is Computer Science, and lower right is Human Language. NLP stays in the middle of all three circles.">
    </figure>

    <p>NLP stands halfway between computer science computational linguistics, and it is dedicated to the conversion of written and spoken natural human languages into structured mineable data. Through the combination of linguistic, statistical and AI methods NLP can be used either to determine the meaning of a text or even to produce a human-like response (Fanni et al.).</p>

    <header><h3>Section 2.2 Basic Concepts</h3></header>
    <figure>
      <img style="width: 70%" style="height:70%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koutiany/ctli-aiposter/blob/main/docs/tutorial/aivisual.png" alt="A diagram of concentric circles representing a hierarchy within Artificial Intelligence concepts. The outermost circle is labeled 'Artificial Intelligence.' Nested within it is 'Machine Learning,' followed by 'Neural Networks,' then 'Deep Learning,' 'Generative AI,' and the innermost circle is 'Large Language Models.' Each term is enclosed within its own larger category, indicating that Large Language Models are a specific part of Generative AI, which is a type of Deep Learning, and so on, up to the broad field of Artificial Intelligence">

    <h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI):  A Field of Study</h4>
    <p>A common definition of AI is that it is a technology that enables machines to imitate various complex human skills (Sheikh et al.).</p>
      <hr/>
    <h4>Machine Learning (ML): A Branch of AI</h4>
    <p>Machine Learning refers to the methods and algorithms that enable AI systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through all sources of input data (Sun et al.).</p>
      <hr/>
    <h4>Neural Networks (NN): Subsets of ML</h4>
    <p>Neural networks are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another (Caprasi).</p>
      <hr/>
    <h4>Deep Learning (DL): A subset of NN</h4>
    <p>“Deep” refers to the depth of layers in a neural network (Caprasi).</p>
      <hr/>
    <h4>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI): A Subset of DL</h4>
    <p>Gen AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that applies computational techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, to generate seemingly new content in the forms of text, images, audio, and video from training data (Yu and Guo; Feuerriegel et al.).</p>
      <hr/>
    <h4>Large Language Models (LLMs): A Form of GenAI</h4>
    <p>LLM focuses on generating human-like text based on the patterns learned from vast amounts of textual data during training process (Caprasi).</p>
      <hr/>
    <h4>GPT-3/3.5/4, BERT, Claude, Ernie, Falcon, Gemini, Llama</h4>
    <p>These are all large language models.</p>
